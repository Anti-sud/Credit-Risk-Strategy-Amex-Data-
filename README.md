# Credit-Risk-Strategy-Amex-Data-

üí≥ Credit Risk Modeling with XGBoost
This repository contains the complete workflow for a Credit Risk Modeling project using real-world inspired data, performed as part of an advanced machine learning case study. The goal is to predict customer default likelihood using historical transaction and behavior data.

üìÅ Project Files

Modeling results

Comparison of XGBoost and Neural Network models

Final recommendation and strategic use cases

üß† Key Techniques Used
Pandas chunked data processing for large datasets

One-hot encoding of categorical features

Aggregation by customer ID

Model selection based on average AUC and variance

SHAP values for feature importance interpretation

Grid search with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

‚úÖ Outcomes
XGBoost outperformed Neural Network models in AUC across training and test samples.

Grid search helped in balancing performance and overfitting.

The model can support both conservative and aggressive credit approval strategies based on default probability thresholds.

üìå How to Use
